# BrandTrace : Brand Provenance on Blockchain

## Problem:
* Fake products can be widely found in the market
* Untransparent supply chain
* Unable to prove the origin of the product
* Unable to trust proof and certificates from other countries
* **USE CASE** => brand traceability and anti-counterfeiting
* **Outside of brand name** => we can adapt the same system into a food and pharmaceutical provenance to avoid fake or uncertified items

## Why Blockchain:
* When brand names are imported, the originality can be hard to track. 
* Central authorities in a specific country might not be trusted by parties outside of the country. 
* For instance, if you buy a Louis Vuitton bag from Paris, the bag will probably cost a fortune. This implies that customers will be more comfortable if they are provided with provenance from LV itself and these origin proof’s integrity should remain. 
* Smart contract are globally trusted (if the system is fully open sourced and well-designed)
